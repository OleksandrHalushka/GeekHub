Still, I will have one mediocre interview where I look mediocre or just bad that renders the other 5 interviews useless. It’s like I have to look like a 10x developer for 5 interviews in a row while my interviewer looks for a tiny reason to disqualify me. The company recruiter will say the interviewer is looking to see how I think, but often interviewers will fail me for the code not compiling that I wrote on a white board. I had interviews where I write the best solution, and the interviewer will fail me because I missed a opportunity to optimize the algorithm for a edge case. I have seen interviewers add extra requirements to try and trick me at the end of a long on-site. I understand why big companies try not to give feedback because the reasons that interviewers fail candidates sound so absurd that one can only imagine if being same race&#x2F;gender as the interviewer would have change the outcome. Does anyone find the current interviewing landscape ridiculous?

I did not offer anything in return because of the information I grew up with. Until today. I assume that in the post-critical mass internet (and the perhaps the ongoing administration apocalypse), their time has become a very valuable resource.<p>Anyways, a small handful of them agreed to take a look, but no one has responded. It&#x27;s not a simple solution so I take it its not worth their _free_ time to poke into it.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what I should be offering in return for their time. Should I pay them? Offer them co-authorship if they want to work on it with me (for free?)?<p>I dont have an academic background so I need help putting together a white paper and probably need someone established to vouch for me to get it published, if successful. Plus I need someone experienced to poke holes in the algorithm.<p>I know the algorithm[1] has potential because it&#x27;s functioning in the video game I was working on before I diverted my resources into the graph theory.<p>[1] I created an improved general solution to any pathfinding algorithm that searches for more than one path, e.g. All Pairs, k-Shortest Simple; for any type of graph (directed, undirected, +weighted, possibly +&#x2F;- weighted).

To name a few examples: jQuery, Lodash, React.<p>It seems like the benefits of this would be significant for both user and developer - faster loading, lower bandwidth, quicker builds, etc.<p>It also seems eminently doable, technically. One possible high-level implementation off the top of my head:<p>- A standard index of the most popular libs is maintained.<p>- You pull them in via the script tag, with a new lib=&quot;name@version&quot; attribute. Older browsers can use the src tag as a backup.<p>- SPA build systems like webpack et al are aware of the standard and can just not bundle libs pulled this way, while keeping the require() and import syntax.<p>I do, however, see some pretty big not-strictly-technical difficulties:<p>- The index would have to be administered by some entity. Who would that be, and who would pay for it?<p>- Who defines what the most popular libs are? Whatever system is used, how do you prevent it being gamed to the advantage of particular libs?<p>- Trust and security. A similar set of issues npm faces. Although that being the case, is this really introducing a new problem? It also seems like a much narrower problem if we&#x27;re only talking about a small set of very popular libs.<p>- Maybe some issues around licensing, bundling code into browsers etc. But again, if it&#x27;s a smallish set of only very popular libs, this seems like it could be dealt with individually for each one and its authors, maybe as a prerequisite for getting included in the index.<p>These difficulties are not insignificant, but nor do they seem insurmountable and also the benefits do seem genuinely worth it.<p>It just appears to me to be something that should so obviously have been done, that there must be really good reasons why it hasn&#x27;t been - maybe including those above, maybe technical, maybe others.<p>Does anyone know if any serious attempt has ever been made at a proposal to do something like this, even if in a non-standard way by an individual browser vendor?",1643241265,Ask HN: Why don't browsers pre-include popular JavaScript libraries?,story,None

As a rule, this is 1 year of cliff + 4 years of vesting. I&#x27;m not going to talk about cliff and vesting. To make a long story short, you have to work for 5 years.

One of them really stands out and I would love to read it again. The gist of it:<p>The main character (1st person) goes into work and some casual games are played that day (throughout the story he remains neutral). Over time, more games are played and everyone begins taking them more seriously. Soon the office separates into different cliques (marketing, sales, IT, etc), and the games evolve into competitive, office wide nerf gun fights. People start making bases out of their cubicles (roofs and all), eventually sleeping inside of them, fearing to leave them unguarded. It keeps escalating. People begin bringing hand guns&#x2F;rifles into work and plot how to knock out the other teams. Then I think it ends with the guy walking outside to the parking lot to have a smoke after speaking to the head IT guy (who hasnt showered nor left his base in days).",1643231553,Ask HN: Where can I find the old internet's short stories/fiction?,story,None
