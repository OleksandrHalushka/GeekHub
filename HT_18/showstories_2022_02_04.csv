It&#x27;s a fun game to host at a demoparty and project on a big screen - We did that at Instanssi many times. The implementation is still rough, and suffers from the fast pace of the modern web - The frontend is likely very outdated, and the backend is built with Vapor 2 and Swift 3.1, both no longer supported. You <i>can</i> host this yourself, but it might be a bit of a pain to set up. The WebSocket protocol is fairly trivial to work out and write a bot for to ruin the whole canvas, but I trust that the HN crowd can come up with clever things to draw with a script, should they choose to do so.

ersatz_username,0,30163104,[30163111],43,"Visions is a python library for working with user defined data type systems. Out of the box, it provides type inference and automated data cleaning of sequence data with backend specific implementations for pandas, spark, python, and numpy. We often use it as a first pass cleaning step when working with tabular data and to simplify the backend logic of both pandas-profiling[1] and our tabular data compression library compressio[2].<p>Because data types are user defined, we can build user customizable libraries based around types without adding code complexity. In the case of compressio that means offering users the ability to use any compression algorithm they want by simply passing a dictionary mapping `{type: compression algorithm}` or defining new compression algorithms for otherwise unsupported data types like shapely geometries, images, etc.<p>We hope you like it and would really appreciate feedback about how to make the library more useful and easier to use.<p>P.S.

The reason I’m posting is that I thought I’d write about the product I’ve been building, in hopes it resonates with people.<p>Why build yet another social app? Because I deleted almost all social media around 3&#x2F;4 years ago as it was just net negative on my life. There was very little that was truly interesting, I didn’t care about looking good to other people and because of the ‘media’ and ads, the apps were all designed to make me spend too much time for what I was getting. I hated it and what it meant for people’s behaviour, including mine and my friends.<p>I also noticed that the vast majority of my friends were pretty much passive on the services, even if they had an account. Turns out that most people felt uncomfortable sharing to people they didn’t know too well, which inevitably happens as you meet new people, add them, and often don’t develop the relationship much further. I had a sense that there could be a better way.<p>In that, I remembered the days of Path and Google+ which had the model of focusing on particular people in your network, both through the feed and in how you shared. Path in particular was a ‘real life’ social network, something that despite being brought to market in 2010 or whatever, seemed to be more relevant today.<p>So problem found, problem solved. I took the journey of learning how to code when COVID hit (I was working in Architecture and Design and was about to start my masters degree at Harvard GSD in Boston), then one thing led to another, my prototype garnered some investment interest, and Circles was born.<p>The idea is very much like the name suggests, it’s about adding your contacts (synced through your phonebook) into Circles that define what the relationship is. This means that you only see things from people you have tagged (rather than everyone) and when you share, you choose exactly who it goes to (rather than all your friends or followers).<p>It also takes cues from other privacy focused social products. Posts are encrypted, reactions and comments are only shown to people who are contacts with eachother, and user profiles only show that which has been explicitly shared to the user viewing the profile.<p>As they were mentioned briefly before, it’s essentially a crossover between Path and Google+ with a wrap around layer of privacy, so the potential revenue has to eventually come through paid features rather than ads.<p>We’re in the app store and google play store (yay, cross-platform JS frameworks), the invite code is ‘FULLCIRCLE’ and download links are below:<p>Landing: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;oncircles.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;oncircles.com</a><p>iOS: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;gb&#x2F;app&#x2F;circles-share-more-with-less&#x2F;id1532621483"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;gb&#x2F;app&#x2F;circles-share-more-with-less&#x2F;i...</a><p>Android: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=com.oncircles"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=com.oncircles</a><p>I would love to hear your feedback and suggestions on the idea.

We&#x27;re looking for feedback from parents.<p>We&#x27;re 2 dads who started working on Dadditude in the midst of covid lockdowns last year.<p>Being a dad can be a long, emotional, draining, and lonely journey. Through our research we learned that dads want to improve their parenting but are too shy to ask for help, and are tired of reading content online written for mums. We set out to fix that and create a platform that would help dads feel seen, validated, and supported.
By helping dads, we hope to support moms and partners too, because all parents deserve more support.<p>Quick timeline so far:
We started a community of dads on Instagram last Feb to test hypothesis and learn about their needs. We then launched an MVP in April, a super simple app serving weekly coaching guides created with a parenting professional partner.
We made several updates in summer and fall, working like crazy in the background to convince parenting professionals to write coaching guides for us. Especially hard when you&#x27;re a nobody. But people are kind and we found all the support we needed.
We launched a v1 app mid-December with 50 coaching guides and a more full fledge community board (and a paid membership tier).
We&#x27;ve just added on-demand parenting professional support in Jan.
And last week added a picture board for dads to upload pics of their families, and that&#x27;s become more popular than the forums!! ← I knew dads wanted to feel more visible but  I love these discoveries!<p>Super proud of the work done so far, but still so much to do to smooth out the product experience, and get closer to PFM. So much learning.<p>web: <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dadditude.app"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dadditude.app</a>

Geeta2101,0,30176388,None,3,"Hi,<p>In the past few years, I have discovered and tested the benefits of goal settings and visualization. I have formed this habit of writing my goals as affirmations in a pocket diary and reading it every morning. However, there are days when I forget to do it and then lose momentum.<p>So, I thought of a chrome extension with a minimal interface where I can add all my affirmations, and then it displays them on a new tab throughout the day, one affirmation at a time.<p>With the help of my teammate, I have created exactly this. It&#x27;s called &#x27;Affirmations Flow.&#x27;<p>This is how it works:<p>- When you add it to the chrome, it comes with a few sample affirmations preloaded
- You can edit and replace them with your affirmations.
- Click save, and you are set.
- When you open a new tab next time, it will shuffle play those affirmations displaying each affirmation for thirty minutes so that you can focus on it.
- If you are in public place and do not want others to see your affirmations, there is an option to hide the shuffle and the extension gives you a blank screen new tab with beautiful floating bubbles.<p>It&#x27;s totally free.<p>Here is the link if you want try it out:
